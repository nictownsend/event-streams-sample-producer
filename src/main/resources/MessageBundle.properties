producer.summary = This tool can be used to produce load to your Kafka cluster. To run you will need to generate a 'producer.config' file and configure to point to the cluster. If you do not have a 'producer.config' file, one can be generated by running using --gen-config flag.
producer.configSection = Configuration commands
producer.requiredConfigSection = Required arguments
producer.generalConfigSection = Additional arguments
producer.topic.help = he topic to produce messages to. This must already exist on your Kafka cluster.
producer.payloadTemplate.help = a template file to generate the message payloads from. Payloads will be randomly generated from this file.
producer.throughput.help = throttle maximum message sent per thread to approximately THROUGHPUT messages a second. By default this is unthrottled.
producer.producerConfigFile.help = producer configuration properties file. This can be generated via the --gen-config command. If specified, the tool will attempt to load 'producer.config' in the current working directory.
producer.numThreads.help = the number of threads (one producer per thread).
producer.numRecords.help = the total number of records to send (distributed evenly across all producers).
producer.genConfig.help = This command will generate a 'producer.config' file which will define the basic configuration required to produce messages to a Kafka instance. You must edit to add your cluster details.
producer.payload.options = Finally, --payload-template-file must be specified pointing to a payload template.

producer.fileGenerated = A 'producer.config' file has been successfully generated in your current working directory. Modify this file as described and provide this file to future runs via the --producer.config argument.
producer.fileGenerationFail = An error occurred while generating the 'producer.config' file.
producer.argsMissing = 'Warning: One or more required arguments were not provided. Please review the expected arguments and your provided input.'
producer.invalidThreads = 'Error: You specified an invalid number of threads. Please specify a positive integer value.'
producer.invalidThroughput = 'Error: You specified an invalid number throughput value. Please specify either -1 for unlimited, or a positive integer value.'
