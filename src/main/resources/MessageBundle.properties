# This file contains translations for the sample workload generator for the DEFAULT locale.

producer.summary = This tool can be used to produce load to your Kafka cluster. To run you will need to modify the 'producer.config' file to reference your bootstrap servers and provide the required security information. If you do not have a 'producer.config' file, one can be generated by running --gen-config command.
producer.configSection = Configuration commands
producer.requiredConfigSection = Required arguments
producer.generalConfigSection = Additional arguments
producer.topic.help = the topic to produce messages to. This must already exist on your Kafka cluster.
producer.payloadTemplate.help = a template file to generate the message payloads from. Payloads will be randomly generated from this file.
producer.throughput.help = throttle maximum message sent per thread to approximately THROUGHPUT messages a second. By default this is unthrottled.
producer.producerConfigFile.help = producer configuration properties file. This file defines where your Event Streams instance is, security credentials to connect to it, and other producer configuration options. This can be generated via the --gen-config command. If not specified, the tool will assume this configuration is in the current working directory.
producer.numThreads.help = the number of threads on which to run producers. Total load will be split between the threads.
producer.genConfig.help = This command will generate a 'producer.config' file which will define the basic configuration required to produce messages to an Event Streams instance. You will need to modify this file. For guidance on the configuration options and how to change them, refer to the comments in the file.
producer.payload.options = Finally, --payload-template-file must be specified pointing to a payload template.

producer.fileGenerated = A 'producer.config' file has been successfully generated in your current working directory. Modify this file as described and provide this file to future runs via the --producer.config argument.
producer.fileGenerationFail = An error occurred while generating the 'producer.config' file.
producer.argsMissing = 'Warning: One or more required arguments were not provided. Please review the expected arguments and your provided input.'
producer.invalidThreads = 'Error: You specified an invalid number of threads. Please specify a positive integer value.'
producer.invalidThroughput = 'Error: You specified an invalid number throughput value. Please specify either -1 for unlimited, or a positive integer value.'
