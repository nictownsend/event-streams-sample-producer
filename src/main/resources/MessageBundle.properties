# This file contains translations for the sample workload generator for the DEFAULT locale.

runner.summary = This tool can be used to produce load to your Kafka cluster. To run you will need to generate a 'runner.config' file and configure to point to the cluster. If you do not have a 'runner.config' file, one can be generated by running using --gen-config flag.
runner.configSection = Configuration commands
runner.requiredConfigSection = Required arguments
runner.generalConfigSection = Additional arguments
runner.topic.help = he topic to produce messages to. This must already exist on your Kafka cluster.
runner.payloadTemplate.help = a template file to generate the message payloads from. Payloads will be randomly generated from this file.
runner.payloadStartFrom.help = timestamp to start generating messages from, defaults to current date. Format: dd-MM-yyyy'T'HH:mm:ss
runner.throughput.help = throttle maximum message sent per thread to approximately THROUGHPUT messages a second. By default this is unthrottled.
runner.producerConfigFile.help = Producer configuration properties file. This can be generated via the --gen-config command. If specified, the tool will attempt to load 'runner.config' in the current working directory.
runner.numThreads.help = the number of threads (one runner per thread).
runner.numRecords.help = the total number of records to send (distributed evenly across all runners).
runner.genConfig.help = This command will generate a 'runner.config' file which will define the basic configuration required to produce messages to a Kafka instance. You must edit to add your cluster details.
runner.batchMode.help = Output to console instead of Kafka.
runner.payloadStartTimestamp.help = Output to console instead of Kafka.
runner.payloadEndTimestamp.help = Output to console instead of Kafka.

runner.payload.options = Finally, --payload-template-file must be specified pointing to a payload template.

runner.fileGenerated = A 'runner.config' file has been successfully generated in your current working directory. Modify this file as described and provide this file to future runs via the --runner.config argument.
runner.fileGenerationFail = An error occurred while generating the 'producer.config' file.
runner.argsMissing = 'Warning: One or more required arguments were not provided. Please review the expected arguments and your provided input.'
runner.invalidThreads = 'Error: You specified an invalid number of threads. Please specify a positive integer value.'
runner.invalidThroughput = 'Error: You specified an invalid number throughput value. Please specify either -1 for unlimited, or a positive integer value.'
